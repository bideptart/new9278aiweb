          <strong>United States</strong> — committed to the principles of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and
          Section 508.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>EU</strong> — committed to the European Accessibility Act (Directive 2019/882, applicable from 28 June
          2025) and EN 301 549.

      <h2>2. What We Do and Current Status</h2>
      <p>
        We design for keyboard and screen-reader use, clear focus states, readable contrast, and meaningful labels and
        alt text, and we support browser/OS accessibility features. Current status: partially conforming with WCAG 2.1
        AA; some third-party components and newer features may not yet fully conform. We review accessibility on an
        ongoing basis as we ship changes.
