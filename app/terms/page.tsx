        <h2 id="description">2. Description of Services</h2>
        <h3>2.1 General</h3>
        <p>
          9278.ai provides software that lets businesses build, launch, and scale AI voice agents capable of handling
          inbound and outbound phone calls. The platform runs an audio-native conversational engine, supports real
          interruptions and multilingual conversations, and can answer from a knowledge base you connect.
        </p>
        <h3>2.2 Service Provision</h3>
        <p>
          The Services are provided through a self-hosted control panel, web dashboard, and APIs. You are responsible
          for configuring your agents, prompts, guardrails, knowledge sources, and integrations.
        </p>
        <h3>2.3 Service Nature</h3>
        <p>
          9278.ai is a software and connectivity platform. We do not sell phone numbers. Phone numbers, SIP trunks, and
          call termination are provided by the carrier account you connect to the Services, and remain billed by, and
          subject to the terms of, that carrier.
        </p>
        <h3>2.4 Features and Limitations</h3>
        <p>
          Features, capacity (including the number of concurrent agents available on your plan), latency, and language
          coverage may vary and may change over time. We may add, modify, or remove features at our discretion.
        </p>
        <h3>2.5 &ldquo;As Is&rdquo; Provision</h3>
        <p>
          Except as expressly stated in this Agreement, the Services are provided on an &ldquo;as is&rdquo; and
          &ldquo;as available&rdquo; basis. See Section 16.
        </p>
        <h3>2.6 Geographic Availability</h3>
        <p>
          The Services may not be available in all jurisdictions, and availability may depend on your carrier and on
          applicable law. You are responsible for ensuring your use is lawful in your jurisdiction and in any
          jurisdiction you place or receive calls.
        </p>
        <h3>2.7 Service Availability Disclaimer</h3>
        <p>
          We strive for high availability but do not guarantee uninterrupted or error-free operation. Service may be
          affected by maintenance, third-party providers, carriers, or events beyond our control.
        </p>
        <h3>2.8 Service Testing</h3>
        <p>
          We may test, monitor, and diagnose the Services, including by temporarily processing or recording call audio
          for troubleshooting, which is deleted after the troubleshooting period.
        </p>
        <h3>2.9 Third-Party Carriers and Providers</h3>
        <p>
          The Services depend on third-party carriers, telephony, cloud, and AI/model providers. We are not responsible
          for the acts, omissions, outages, or charges of those providers, and your use of them is subject to their
          terms.
        </p>
        <h3>2.10 Data Storage and Backup</h3>
        <p>
          We store account data, agent configurations, logs, and — where you enable them — call recordings and
          transcripts, subject to our Privacy Policy and retention timelines. You are responsible for maintaining your
          own backups of content you consider critical.
        </p>
        <h3>2.11 Call Recording and Transcription</h3>
        <p>
          Where you enable call recording, transcription, or conversation logging, you are solely responsible for
          providing any legally required notices to, and obtaining any required consent from, the individuals your
          agents interact with, in every applicable jurisdiction.
        </p>

        </p>
        <h3>3.4 Account Security and Responsibility</h3>
        <p>

        </p>
        <h3>3.6 Third-Party Logins and Integrations</h3>
        <p>
          If you connect third-party services (such as a carrier, CRM, calendar, or knowledge source), you authorize us
          to access and exchange data with those services as needed to provide the Services, subject to their terms.
        </p>
        <h3>3.7 Activation</h3>

        <h2 id="duration">4. Service Duration and Renewal</h2>
        <h3>4.1 Term</h3>
        <p>This Agreement applies for as long as you use the Services or maintain an account.</p>
        <h3>4.2 Voice Credit and Top-Ups</h3>
        <p>
          The Services operate on a prepaid voice-credit model. There are no long-term contracts or minimum commitments
          beyond your chosen top-up. Voice credit is valid for the period stated at purchase (currently 60 days from
          purchase) and expires thereafter.
        </p>
        <h3>4.3 No Automatic Renewal of Credit</h3>
        <p>
          Voice credit does not automatically renew. You choose when to top up. Where you opt in to any auto-recharge
          feature, you authorize us to charge your payment method to maintain a credit balance, and you may disable it
          at any time.
        </p>

        <h2 id="fees">5. Fees, Payments, and Billing</h2>
        <h3>5.1 General Fees</h3>
        <p>
          Use of the Services requires purchasing voice credit. Voice usage is charged on a per-minute basis according
          to your plan tier (currently from $0.15/min on Starter, $0.12/min on Growth, and $0.10/min on Scale). Top-up
          amounts (currently $20, $50, or $100) determine your tier and the number of concurrent AI agents available
          (currently up to 1, 2, or 3 respectively). Current pricing is published at{" "}
          <Link href="/pricing">www.9278.ai/pricing</Link> and forms part of this Agreement.
        </p>
        <h3>5.2 Payment Methods</h3>
        <p>
          You agree to provide a valid payment method and authorize us to charge all applicable fees. By providing a
          payment method, you authorize us to invoice your account for amounts due.
        </p>
        <h3>5.3 Payment Information Storage</h3>
        <p>
          We use third-party payment processors to process and securely store payment information. For your security, we
          do not directly store full payment card details. By using the Services, you consent to the processing of your
          payment information by these processors under their privacy and security practices (typically PCI DSS
          certified).
        </p>
        <h3>5.4 Pricing Changes</h3>
        <p>
          We may change pricing, tiers, or credit terms at our discretion. Changes apply to future purchases and will be
          reflected at <Link href="/pricing">www.9278.ai/pricing</Link>. Credit already purchased is governed by the
          terms in effect at the time of purchase.
        </p>
        <h3>5.5 Usage Billing</h3>
        <p>
          Voice usage is deducted from your credit balance in real time or shortly after each call, based on connected
          call duration and your applicable per-minute rate. Carrier and phone-number charges are billed separately by
          your carrier.
        </p>
        <h3>5.6 No Hidden Fees</h3>
        <p>
          There are no setup fees, contracts, or minimums beyond your top-up. Any taxes are additional as described
          below.
        </p>
        <h3>5.7 Currency</h3>
        <p>Unless otherwise stated, fees are quoted and charged in US dollars.</p>
        <h3>5.8 Insufficient Balance and Non-Payment</h3>
        <p>
          If your credit balance is exhausted or a charge fails, affected Services (including active agents and calls)
          may be suspended or limited until sufficient credit is available.
        </p>
        <h3>5.9 Chargebacks</h3>
        <p>
          You agree to contact us to resolve billing concerns before initiating a chargeback. Chargebacks made in bad
          faith may result in suspension or termination.
        </p>
        <h3>5.10 Credit Expiration</h3>
        <p>
          Unused voice credit expires at the end of its validity period (currently 60 days from purchase) and is not
          recoverable or refundable after expiry.
        </p>
        <h3>5.11 Taxes / VAT</h3>
        <p>
          Fees are exclusive of taxes. You are responsible for any applicable VAT, GST, sales, or similar taxes, which
          may be added to your charges.
        </p>
        <h3>5.12 Refund Policy</h3>
        <p>
          Except where required by applicable law, voice credit and fees are non-refundable. Specific refund
          eligibility, if any, is described at <Link href="/pricing">www.9278.ai/pricing</Link> or our{" "}
