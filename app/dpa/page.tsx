      <p>
        This Data Processing Agreement (&ldquo;DPA&rdquo;) forms part of the{" "}
        <Link href="/terms">Master Services Agreement</Link> between Ace Peak Invest Pte Ltd operating 9278.ai
        (&ldquo;Processor&rdquo;, &ldquo;we&rdquo;) and the business customer (&ldquo;Controller&rdquo;,
        &ldquo;Customer&rdquo;). It applies where 9278.ai processes Customer Personal Data on the Customer&apos;s behalf —
        in practice, the personal data of the Customer&apos;s callers handled by the AI agent. For 9278.ai&apos;s own

        Customer&apos;s documented instructions (the MSA, this DPA, and the Customer&apos;s configuration and use of the
        Services), unless required otherwise by law (in which case 9278.ai informs the Customer where lawful).

          AI-interaction data, contact records.

        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. Customer Obligations</h2>
      <p>

        The Customer authorises 9278.ai to engage the sub-processors in the{" "}
